## A Google Chrome Extension for the Dark Mode in every website!

Invert pages colors (but not their images!) on Google Chrome to reduce strain on eyes and improve readability at night, keeping the setting for the domains where it was activated. 
#### Get the dark mode (or light mode) on unsupported websites, activate and deactive with an unique button!
